                          <p class="para">Technology is becoming ubiquitous in everyday life, connecting, informing, and empowering the user like never before. However, as technology becomes more integral to everything we do, it can sometimes distract us from the things that matter most to us. The challenge designer’s face is how to ensure technology improves life, not distract from it. What do users need to develop their own sense of digital wellbeing? So that life, not the technology in it, stays front and centre.</p>
					
                    
                      <h4 class="overview">Goal</h4>
                      <p class="para">Users have an increasing number of tools, apps, and device settings to help them manage their own digital wellbeing. However, without the necessary knowledge or insights, the mere presence of tools is insufficient.

					  <h4 class="overview">Challenge Statement</h4>
					  <ul>
                      <li class="para"><strong>Digital wellbeing has recently been introduced</strong> as the new definition for manufacturers, scientists, psychologists to describe the interactions between people and technology in a measurable way. Thus, while the smartphone was established nearly 2 decades ago, the concept of digital wellbeing is still new to users.</li>
						  
					  <li class="para"><strong>Users are diverse, and the concept of wellbeing is very subjective</strong> to people according to their cultures, personalities and demographics. With such a large number of influencing variables, it will be challenging to identify a consistent scale for users’ awareness of digital wellbeing.</li>
						  
					  <li class="para"><strong>Manufacturers introduce wellbeing features as a way to enhance the awareness of wellbeing while third party wellbeing apps may have mixed motivations. </strong> Therefore, this might create a gap in users understanding of digital awareness, with perception being driven by curiosity rather than self-consciousness. This might affect our insights of using wellbeing apps/tools/features.</li>
						  
					  <li class="para"><strong>Project is limited in 2 weeks of research and 1 sprint.</strong> Time limitation is challenging to us and will result in a smaller scale of research and findings which might cause some biases in the final result.</li>

					  <ul>
                      <li class="para">We began with making assumptions according to the provided problem space. Following this, we conducted secondary research to broaden our understanding about Digital Wellbeing. </li>
						  
					  <li class="para">After compiling our thoughts and findings, we assigned team members around the project goals and developed a research plan and methods. At this point, we decided to implement quantitative and qualitative research, through a survey and interviews, to achieve our research objectives. We decided to skip Personas because our research space mainly focuses on behaviours and attitude instead of demographic. Besides, Google wellbeing tools are not targeting specific groups but Google Pixel phone users in general.</li>
						  
					  <li class="para">Once the research was complete, we analyzed the results with affinity mapping and customer journey mapping to identify any patterns and journeys that could aid in answering the research objectives. </li>

					   <h4 class="overview">Competitive Smartphone Analysis</h4>
              <p class="para">As part of our research in wellbeing domain, we conducted a competitive study between Google, Apple, and Samsung. We analysed how these brands handle wellbeing and what features they offer for their users. Apart from the inbuilt wellbeing features, we looked into how wearables add value by tracking sleep, heart rate, blood pressure and exercise.</p>
