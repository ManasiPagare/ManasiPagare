It is essential that the platform should be user-friendly and visually appealing to the audience of a particular field. Users come across various websites and apps one better than the other, most of them aiming to provide a better experience. Therefore, the users are habituated to get all the information they want without a hassle and perform simple interactions to get their work done.Our Research was based on solving and finding following research statements.

                      <p class="para">Kiwiburn wanted to work on the redesigning of the Kiwiburn website as the visuals don’t suit the vibe of the festival.The purpose  that defines the festival is missing in the website and the users have to access two platforms “Kiwiburn Facebook page” and “Kiwiburn Website” for two different purposes which is troublesome. Understanding the needs of the user while accessing the two different platforms can help us combine the two platform in one main platform effectively.</p>

                              <li><strong style="color: #F1C231;">Sampling Bias - </strong>For the survey, the only focus was the people who have been a part of the Kiwiburn festival as they are the main target audience. The survey was posted on the Facebook group and was sent through the Kiwiburn newsletter which was the only two means of getting the responses as the target audience was present in those groups.</li>
							  
                              <li><strong style="color: #F1C231;">Time Bias - </strong> As there was only two medium through which the survey can be sent the time to get sufficient responses were about one and a half weeks of the wait. In the meantime had covered our interviews and analysis on them but had to wait for the survey responses. </li>
							  
							  <li><strong style="color: #F1C231;">Personal Bias - </strong> Our assumption could vary from the response we received as we had our own personal biases and influence on the research as our thoughts are not similar to the type the focused audience have.</li>

                      <p class="para">Our main target audience is the users who have attended the Kiwiburn festival from the ages 19 years and above. As the Kiwiburn has already a huge crowd of about 5000 who request for ticket and out of which only 2000 gets the entry for festival. But we have targeted the users who have never been to Kiwiburn to get a third-party insight.

              <p class="para">We started with understanding the deep roots of the festival as we had never come across a burning man festival. While investigating about the Kiwiburn festival we inferred that it is a participatory festival where all can participate and volunteer to make the festival successful. There is no center stage or any particular activity that can be highlighted, anyone can register and plan their own activity/event. In Kiwiburn there is no exchange of money the participants simply need to buy the tickets before the festival. People who work for Kiwiburn provide their services voluntarily.</p>
	  
		  <h5><br>Competitive Study</h5>
              <p class="para">To gain a deeper understanding of the festival we decided to look for similar burning man festivals around the globe. This research helped us to get a competitive study of the website as it enabled us to distinguish the experience the other burning man festival provides through their online platforms. Following is the Competitive study.</p>

			  The questions were designed considering these two groups of Interviewees:

                      <p class="para">Considering the Double diamond framework, planning, strategizing, and implementing the plans into actions was helpful. As we got our briefings from our industry partners, we wanted to know more about the community about this festival. We started our secondary research, which involved digging on to the background of Kiwiburn and understanding about the Burning Man festivals worldwide. We used the information on the other burns and did a competitive study with Kiwiburn. Buy comparing it allowed us to gain knowledge of what experience on the online platform they are providing.</p>
 &nbsp;
<p class="para">After that, we began by preparing the questions for quantitative and qualitative research. The interviews helped us to understand how the experience of the users could while accessing the website, and the survey helped us to understand the priority of the sections on the site. Based on the interviews, affinity maps were created, and to make sense of the survey data, the infographic was created. Affinity mapping on the survey data could not be done as it was not a behavioral survey; it was more like a survey trying to understand which information is essential.</p>
						  &nbsp;

<p class="para">Once we got the insights from both the researches sitemap was created. And then personas were designed on two types of users, one who had no idea about Kiwiburn, and the second was the users who were part of Kiwiburn.</p> &nbsp;

<p class="para">Due to time limitations and various other biases, some work in Develop activity, as well as the work in Deliver activity, could not be achieved. But as we will be continuing our project with Psychoactive studios, we are aiming to implement all of the remaining work in these two weeks.</p> &nbsp; 

<p class="para">The experience with Psychoactive studios exciting and challenging, but learned a lot from Andrew ( Director of Psychoactive studios ). He guided us throughout the process; the morning stand up calls gave us a chance to be a part of the industry and know in-depth about the process.</p> &nbsp;

<p class="para">As a whole, a great experience, and from the insights we have gained from the research, will help us create a smooth journey for the user or Kiwiburn.</p>
